# EZstack

EZstack is a restful data store platform for JSON databases that maximizes query capability and efficency using a built-in data denormalization platform.

## Repo Layout

- [ezstack](ezstack/) directory contains the EZstack platform. For EZstack documentation refer to [here](ezstack/README.md).
- [data-sets](data-sets/) contains some test data sets that were used to test the EZstack datastore as well as some helper scripts.
- [samza-mesos](samza-mesos/) contains an experimental (extreme beta) code base to enable Samza jobs to run ontop of the Mesos platform. For Samza Mesos documentation refer to [here](samza-mesos/README.md).
- [writing](writing/) contains the original proposal of EZstack platform. **Please note that EZstack has evolved and matured further than some of the original writings**.
