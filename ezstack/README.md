# EZstack

### About EZstack
EZstack is a restful data store platform for NoSQL databases that
maximizes query capability and efficency using a built-in data denormalization platform.

### EZapp
EZapp is EZstacks restful interface. It is the primary endpoint that
end users can leverage to interact with the EZstack datastore.

The following table is EZapp RESTful endpoints:

| HTTP Method | URL | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  GET | /sor/1/{table}/{key} | Get the document with the associated table/key. |
| POST | /sor/1/{table}/{key} | Create a document inside the specified table, with the specified key. If document with specified key already exists, then it will over write it. |
| PUT | /sor/1/{table}/{key} | Update or Create a document with specified table/key. |
| POST | /sor/1/{table} | Create a document inside the following table with an autogenerated key. |
| POST | /sor/1/_search/ | Retrieves documents based on EZQL queries. |

The following endpoints are leveraged internally by EZstack. However, they have also been exposed
to external users for more advanced performance tuning by the end user/developer.

| HTTP Method | URL | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /sor/1/_rule/ | Gets all rules. |
| POST | /sor/1/_rule/ | Writes a rule to the system. |
| GET | /sor/1/_rule/_table/{ruleTable} | Gets any rules associated with the following table. |
| PUT | /sor/1/_rule/_table/{ruleTable} | Updates rule status. |
| GET | /sor/1/_rule/{status} | Get all rules matching the following status. |
| GET | /sor/1/_rule/{status}/{outerTable} | Gets all rules matching this status and table name. |
| GET | /sor/1/_rule/{status}/{outerTable}/{innerTable} | Gets all rules matching this status and both inner and outer table of the rule. |

### EZQL
EZQL is EZstack query language. This is the primary way users can
interact with EZapp. Users can leverage EZQL to query the datastore.

The `/sor/1/_search` endpoint expects a query object to be passed to it.

#### Query Object Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| searchTypes | <List> SearchType | | search | Allows you to define the aggregations or type of search. More on this can be found under the SearchType Object. |
| table | <String> table name | Yes | | is the table name that you are attempting to query. |
| filter | <List> Filter | | | Allows you to filter the query. Similar to `where` clause in SQL. More on this can be found under the Filter Object. |
| join | <Query> Nested Queries | Yes* | | Enables you to nest queries. Similar to inner join in SQL. |
| joinAttributeName | <String> attribute name | | _joinAttribute | Enables you to specify the attribute name that the `join` query result will be under. |
| joinAttributes | <List> JoinAttribute | Yes* | | Specifies the attributes between the top query and the inner query should be joined on. More on this can be found under JoinAttribute. |
| excludeAttributes | <List> exclude attributes | | | Set of string attributes that should be removed from document. |
| includeAttributes | <List> include attributes | | | Set of string attributes that should be included from the document.  Similar to SQL SELECT specific column names. |

\* Indicates that parameter is optional, however if `join` is supplied than `joinAttributes` must also be supplied.

#### SearchType Object Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | <Enum> search type | Yes | the type of search operation. The following operations are supported: {search, count, max, min, avg, sum} |
| attributeOn | <String> attribute | Yes* | attribute to apply the search type on. The only one that doesn't need an attribute is **search** because it simply states that you want to retrieve the documents rather than do aggregations on them. |


#### Filter Object Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attribute | <String> attribute | Yes | Attribute to filter on. |
| op | <Enum> string operation | Yes | Operation to execute on filter. Supported operations both in long notation and mathematical form: {eq (==), not_eq (!=), gt (>), gte (>=), lt (<), lte (<=)} |
| value | <Object> value | Yes | static value the filter is comparing the document attribute against. |


#### JoinAttribute Object Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| outerAttribute | <String> attribute | Yes | The outer query table attribute that is being joined on. Such as primary key. |
| innerAttribute | <String> attribute | Yes | The inner query table attribute that is being joined on. Such as foreign key. |
