						Modern data intensive software stacks consist of much more than a relational database. EZStack represents a new, innovative way to think about data denormalization. The goal of the project is to provide a highly scalable, highly efficient, eventually consistent data stack. This product is designed to benefit big-data companies in achieving an efficient, highly scalable data processing system with a simple interface, thus eliminating engineering difficulties within the data model. While most other big data stacks attempt to tackle these problems by investing large amounts of resources in developing their own custom solutions that are highly specific to their case, EZStack will attempt to provide a general solution that is applicable to many different use-cases, favoring ease-of-use and customization.
